          "summary": "Imagine electricity like a bunch of tiny particles (electrons) rushing through a wire like a water slide. That’s electric current! It tells us how many charges are passing through every second. We measure it in amperes using a special tool called an ammeter. The formula I = Q/t helps you find current when you know the total charge and time.",

          "summary": "Voltage is like the push that makes electric charges move. This push is called potential difference, and it’s what drives the current through a circuit. We measure it in volts using a voltmeter, which is connected in parallel. The formula V = W/Q tells us how much energy is used to move a certain amount of charge.",

          "summary": "Ohm’s Law is like the ultimate cheat code for electric circuits. It connects voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) with the equation V = IR. This means if you know any two of these values, you can always find the third! Resistance tells us how much a material resists the flow of current. This law only works when the temperature is constant.",

              "answer": "Ohm’s Law states that current is directly proportional to voltage when temperature is constant. The formula is V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.",
